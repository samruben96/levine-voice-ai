             requests, but the team at Info@HLInsure.com will
             be happy to help. They typically respond within
             one business day."

                      V
            If still insisting:

             requests, email is our process. The team responds
             quickly. Would you like me to confirm that
             email address again?"

  If: "When will it be processed?"
  Response: "That depends on what you're requesting. The team
             at Info@HLInsure.com will let you know the
             timeline once they receive your request."
